Welcome to the CodeSoft Internship Projects repository! Here, you'll find an assortment of Android app projects I developed during my time as an Android App Developer at CodeSoft.

## Projects

### Alarm Clock

The Alarm Clock project was a fascinating endeavor where I created a feature-rich alarm clock application. This app was designed to provide a seamless wake-up experience with features like multiple alarms and customizable alarm tones. Feel free to explore this project and see how it can improve your morning routine.
